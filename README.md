# AI-MOUSE
Introducing the AI Mouse!🖱️

I’m thrilled to share my project: the "AI Mouse", developed using OpenCV. It's amazing what AI can achieve, often beyond what we imagine.

This AI Mouse is not just about technology; it's about enhancing our daily interactions and making technology more accessible. Imagine controlling your computer with simple gestures or movements, making it easier for everyone, including those with disabilities, to navigate digital spaces.

Creating this has been a fascinating journey, and I’m excited about the possibilities it brings:
🔹 Smoother, more intuitive user experiences.
🔹 Innovative accessibility solutions.
🔹 Expanding the boundaries of human-computer interaction.
